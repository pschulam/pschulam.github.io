I'm currently an applied scientist at <a href='https://www.amazon.science/'>Amazon Alexa AI</a> in Manhattan Beach, CA. I have broad interests in machine learning, statistics, and software, but I especially enjoy working on ways to make machine learning systems more reliable.

I did my PhD in the computer science department at Johns Hopkins University, my masters at CMU, and my undergrad at Princeton. You can find an up-to-date list of my publications on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GSnIrqwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar<a>.

My wife and I have two young kids, and we live in El Segundo, CA. When I'm not wrangling children, I spend a lot of time in the ocean.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
